      <p><strong>Hello.</strong> Thanks for the view.</p>


      <p>I'm Florencia Postacchini, a passionate web developer with experience in creating complete technological solutions.</p>
        <p>My focus includes both frontend and backend development, allowing me to provide a comprehensive perspective.</p>
        <p>I have worked on various projects, from simple web pages to complete enterprise systems, using technologies such as Java, Spring, JS, Vue, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, SQL, among others.</p>
        <p>My main goal is to provide efficient and scalable solutions that improve the user experience and have a positive impact on the business.</p>
        <p>I consider myself a highly committed, creative, and results-oriented professional. </p>
        <p>I am always looking for new challenges that allow me to continue growing and learning in a collaborative environment.</p>
        <p>I have worked on team projects, using agile methodologies, and I have experience in team leadership.</p>
<!-- 
      <p>Defining My Professional Profile</p>

      <p>Make a brief description about who you are according to your own view, mentioning, for example: what you do well, what do you know how to do alone, what are the things you enjoy doing the most, your favourite things, what you like most about another person.</p>
      
      <p>Analize what things you can´t stand, what usually upsets you (comments, attitudes, situations, words, etc.)</p>
      
      <p>What makes you angrier, scared, sad? What can´t you stand?</p>
      
      <p>What kind of people do you find unbearable? And what kind of people do you admire?</p>
      
      <p>Work to be more aware. Being attentive, present and conscious in the day to day (both in pleasant and unpleasant situations), being aware of what happens to you, observe the conditionings to be able to transcend them (realize the character you represent, aquired habits, automated responses) by figuring out our character, we can slowly let go of the fake and keep the authentic, this is slow, daily and long term work.</p>
      
      <p>Make a list with our automatisms, habits, automated responses to everyday situations that tend to repeat themselves. To beging to figure out how the character acts.</p>
      
      <p>See what makes you suffer, there you discover what needs to be developed. See which situations tend to repeat themselves in life.</p>
      
      <p>Create new responses to situations. In view of the situations, act proactiveley and develop answers diferent from the usual ones.</p>
      
      <p>List everything that matters to you, regardless if that´s what´s expected of you or not.</p>

      <p>ACHIEVEMENTS</p>

      <p>Identifying your personal achievements is important to your career. Follow these steps to clearly see yours.</p>

          <p>1. Create a text file named T1.3_Achievements</p>

          <p>2. List 5 personal achievements. Include as many academic and work achievement as possible. For example:</p>

          <p>I got my degree in Mathematics</p>

          I got a scholarship valued in $ XXXX
          I decided to change my career and attend a course in MindHub.
          
          <p>3. Pick one of your achievements and write a paragraph with “I achieved…” or “I earned….”</p>

          <p>4. Add relevant information to your paragraph by answering to the following questions:</p>
          How?
          With whom?
          With what aim (for the company)?
          In what context (what was the difficulty)?
          What was at stake?
          What were the results (numbers)?


          <p>5. Share your example with the two colleagues in your "Triangle Group". Ask for and give feedback.</p>

          <p>6. Write one phrase that best communicates your story to a future employer</p>

      <p>LESSONS LEARNED</p>

          <p>Identifying lessons learned, i.e. findings from success and failures, helps to improve your performance and decision making. Follow these steps to identify yours.</p>

          <p>1. Create a text file and name it T1.4_Lessons.</p>

          <p>2. Write three (3) things that did not go as you expected, and you would make different now. Focus on your work and study background, and how these experiences could be relevant to your overall story. For example:</p>
          An interview in English where you got stuck.
          A project that became unfeasible.
          A workplace situation that caused that you were not promoted.

          <p>3. Use one of your sentences to start a sentence with “I didn’t achieve …”. Answer the following questions to add information:</p>

          How?
          With whom?
          With what aim (for the company)?
          In what context?
          What was at stake?
          What was the consequence (numbers)?
          What did you learn?
          If you had the opportunity to repeat the task or situation, would you have done things differently?
          Have you since applied what you learned?
          Has that yielded improved results?
          What would you have done differently in this situation? How would you have done it?

          <p>4. Share your Lesson Learned with your Triangle Group for feedback.</p>

          <p>5. Rephrase your lesson into one short sentence.</p>

      <p>MY GOAL</p>
      
          <p>Setting goals helps align your focus and promotes a sense of self-mastery. In the end, you can't manage what you don't measure and you can't improve on something you don't manage. In order to start seting your career goals, follow these steps</p>
          
          <p>1. Open a new text file named T1.5_Goal.</p>
          
          <p>2. Consider your professional profile and the market to set your immediate career goal following this course. Write it down like this:</p>
          
          My goal is to: “Get my first job as a Frontend Developer in 3 months maximum in Buenos Aires”.
          
          <p>3. Make sure you use the SMART tool.</p>
          
          <p>SMART is an acronym that you can use to guide your goal setting. It´s crucial to define our personal and professional goals, this being the First step to achieving optimal productivity.</p>
          
                        <p>What are SMART goals and how should i use them?</p>
          
          <p>Specific: each one of the established goals must be delimited and according to your business, to center your efforts on their achievements, for example: filling 5 vacancies.
            Measurable: if it´s specific, it´s mensurable. This way we´ll know if the results are as expected. Following the previous example: make an Excel spreadsheet available that specifies the amount of established interviews, observations and the start and end dates.As William T. Kelvin says:
            “What cannot be measured, cannot be improved”.</p>
          
          <p>Achievable: by achievable we mean that it must be a viable, ambitious and posible goal in regards to the conditions you find yourself in.
            Relevant: coordinate and place your objectives. There´s no point in establishing actions that won´t help with the development of our final goals.
            Timely: this means that they´re limited to a specific time. All the mentioned characteristics, specific, measurable, achievable and relevant, depend on the time in which they must be completed.</p>
            <p>How to set SMART goals?</p>
          
          
          <p>When we venture into the world of setting Smart goals, we assimilate the concepts and start to lose focus on how it should be done.</p>
          
          
          <p>Set the goal. What do you want to achieve? For example, it could be increasing your online sales by 50%, have a greater Brand presence at events (every 3 months go to an event) or take two public speaking courses.</p>
          <p>Customize your goal. Categorize and adapt it to you, your company or your team. It´s very helpful to make a SWOT analysis to be more precise in the changes you want tomake.</p>
          <p>Pick the necessary KPI´s to measure your actions. You Know, mark some ambitious and above all, achievable figures.</p>
          <p>Schedule your goals. It´ll be easier to work to reach them, beacuse you´ll be more motivated to meet deadlines. Some examples could be: increase your Instagram community by 20% every 2 months. Take a course every semsester, take an exam monthly.</p>
          <p>Commit both to your goals and dates. Without commitment, there wont be results. Put every gear to work in a cohesive way and you´ll see your goals fulfilled.</p> -->
